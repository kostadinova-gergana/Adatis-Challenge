The high-level tasks in scope for this engagement are as follows:

- Clean the presently dirty dataset.
- Build a dimensional model star schema, using only facts and dimensions necessary to meet the KPI requirements.
- One dashboard and two reports.
- 8 new KPIs, 3 to be decided by the development team during the project, 5 defined below:
  - Unique order count
  - Average order amount in £
  - YTD internet sales in £
  - YTD shop sales in £
  - Online sales as a percentage of overall sales, excluding customer collections
- Each KPI should also be predicted (3 months forecast), using a machine learning model.
- The Power BI solution should be aligned to best practices.
- The final solution must be presented in Power BI, a single Power BI pbix file will be evaluated. You may use R or Python integration to implement the machine learning algorithms.
- The project will be tracked using scrum methodology using Azure DevOps and all code will be version controlled in GitHub.
